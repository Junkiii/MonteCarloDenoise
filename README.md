# MonteCarloDenoise
This project investigates neural network architectures and learning methods used for denoising images and evaluates their performance. Training neural network models to remove Monte-Carlo noise is done with data sets created by the high- performance renderer Rodent to set up a Rodent-specific denoising approach.
