This is my neural network training library. 
To start a training configured in config.py execute train.py. 
You can also test neural networks with test.py.

It is important that you transform the datasets first with datatransform.py.
Pls specify the data_raw path and the dataset path in the module.
training_data and validation data folders contain the raw training data set 
and test data set used in the thesis. 

For every module you execute (train.py, test.py, datatransform.py, validate.py)
you might have to change some paths or values!
